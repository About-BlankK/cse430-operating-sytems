# cse430-project-1 
Scheduling Queues

This is a project from our CSE 430 Operating Systems class at Arizona State University. 
There is a project description PDF located inside the other_docs folder. 

Included in this project is a makefile, a test script, and test cases (only one so far, more to come)
To run the test script, navigate to the root folder of the project 

  cd ~/path/to/project/cse430-project-1/
  
Then call 
  
  ./test_script
  
The test script will call the makefile to build the project, then compare the test input/output to 
the expected output, show if there are any differences (and WHAT the differences are), then will 
clean up any files it created during the building and testing stages. Finally, it will give you a
score of how many test cases passed and how many failed.
